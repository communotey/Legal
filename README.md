These are the agreements on the acceptable use of communote. We knew people would want to see the current version and the differences between it and previous versions.

**If you are new to this site** and you want to see the differences between versions:

1. Click on the thing that says "20 commits" (or whatever number it is at)
2. Click on the hash `ab39012`

How to understand:

* When a term is defined ("a Term"), the Term will be referenced with a word beginning with a capital letter

If you're a collaborator:
