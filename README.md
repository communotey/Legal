These are the agreements on the acceptable use of communote. We knew people would want to see the current version and the differences between it and previous versions.

**If you are new to this site** and you want to see the differences between versions:

1. [Go to the commits section](https://github.com/communotey/Legal/commits) or click on the thing that says "20 commits" (however many there are)
2. Click on the hash `ab39012`

###How to understand the documentation

* When a term is defined ("a Term"), the Term will be referenced with a word beginning with a capital letter
