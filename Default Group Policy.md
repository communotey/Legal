1 Introduction
---------------

This outlines the group policies that are to be moderated by all abiding groups. While the harassment policy is non-negotiable, this policy is. For that reason, it is more in depth and stricter.

All groups must outline and be transparent about all group policies. All policies must use provable and equally-acting metrics.

Group moderators must be open about whether or not they follow the default group policies.

If groups choose not to follow one or more default group policies, they will be labelled "Alternate Groups". They must provide a disclaimer of the subtractions, additions, and modifications of the policies. Recall: if you are a non-abiding group, members must still abide by the [harassment policy](Harassment Policy).

Groups that choose to subtract or modify group policies are fully allowed. It is meant as a guideline. However, they are policies that may be highly desirable by advertisers and undesirable by those who want freedom of speech and expression. Since there is a smaller ad market for these groups, files posted in such groups will be subject to lower payouts from advertising.

Policies added are also permitted and will be considered regular groups, but still require users to follow the harassment policy.

The purpose of having multiple tiers of multiple tiers of policy is to permit users freedom of speech and expression while giving choice to advertisers and other third parties.

2 Discrimination
----------------

All users must be treated with respect regardless of age, sex, religion, income, weight, type of user, etc.

3 Safety
--------

Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that communote is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.
