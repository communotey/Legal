-----------------------------

Hello Communote members and people of the Internet! We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "agreement") between Communote ("we", "our," "us") and you. This agreement sets the terms of your use of the Communote website and services ("Communote") that include all groups and the Livefyre comments on the Communote domain. This agreement, like this website is meant to encourage a fair and tolerant place for discussion and freedom of speech.

##1	Legal

**1.2.3**	We reserve the right to monitor Communote, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all. However, since the privacy of our users is important, we aim to use the data strictly for purposes of identifying the number of accesses of documents as opposed to who is accessing what documents. Communote will not sell any of your information to any 3rd parties and we aim to implement in-house analytics soon.

When we ask for your age, put your real age or we reserve the right to fine your account upon learning your true.

indemnity

45 All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to communote remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.

46
Specifically, you agree to hold communote, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of communote, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.

disclaimer of warranties

47
communote is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic.
