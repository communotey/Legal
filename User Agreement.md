##3 Communote rules

###3.1 Key Rules

These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect kids, keep Communote running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on Communote. You must:

**3.1.1 Keep Everyone Safe**: You agree to not intentionally jeopardize the health and safety of others or yourself.

**3.1.2 Keep Others' Personal Information Off Communote**: You agree to not post anyone else's sensitive personal information that relates to that person's real world or online identity.

**3.1.4 Protect Kids**: You agree not to post any child pornography or sexually suggestive content involving minors.

**3.1.5 Take Personal Responsibility**: As you use Communote, please remember that your speech may have consequences and could lead to criminal and civil liability.

**3.1.6 Use disclaimers to reduce liabilities**: is your content potentially dangerous, age-restricted (nudity), or could offend certain groups?

###3.2 Community Rules

**3.2.1** Communities may define their own rules and enforce them as they see fit, providing they do not violate the terms of this agreement.

**3.2.2** Forming a community immediately makes you the initial moderator and means you must follow through with the duties of being a moderator

##4 Moderators

###4.1 Moderator Agreement

Moderating a group is an unofficial, voluntary, non-permanent position. We reserve the right to revoke that position for any user at any time. We hope you use it as a leadership role. If you choose to moderate a group, you agree to the following:

**4.1.1** You may not enter into any form of agreement on behalf of Communote, or the community which you moderate, without our written approval.

**4.1.2** You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties. You may, however, brag about it on your resume.

**4.1.3** When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement in communities you moderate, you agree to remove it.

**4.1.4** You will terminate your moderator status when you are no longer willing to perform moderator duties. The exception is if you are managing a page for a periodic course, in which case we urge you to maintain your moderator status until the next period.

**4.1.5** You agree to follow petitions with more than 2/3 approval on DemocracyOS (when we form our own)

###4.2 Termination

To give up your position as moderator, you must either appoint other moderator(s) or hold an election, unless there are already moderators on the team.

##5 Spam

###5.1 Junk

You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, audio or other material that we deem to be junk or spam. Cluttering Communote with this sort of content reduces the quality of the Communote experience for others.

###5.2 False Advertising

You are also prohibited from false advertising products. This includes:

1. Claiming functionality of a product with certainty.
2. Presenting an unatainable price of a product (e.g. hidden fees or not including tax when necessessary without disclaimer).

##6 Edits

You may not purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on Communote unless you have permission to by the user (as in the case of a shared document). This is intended to respect the privacy of Communote users who delete or edit their content, and is not intended to abridge the fair use or the expressive rights shared by us all.

##7 Leave Us Alone

**7.1**: You agree not to interrupt the serving of Communote, introduce malicious code onto Communote, make it difficult for anyone else to use Communote due to your actions, attempt to manipulate votes or Communoteâ€™s systems, or assist anyone in misusing Communote in any way. It takes a lot of work to maintain Communote. Be cool.

**7.2**: We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a Communote security issue, please send an email to [support@communote.co](mailto:support@communote.co).
