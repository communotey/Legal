7.  Moderators

6.2 Forming a community immediately makes you the initial moderator and means you must follow through with the duties of being a moderator

###4.1 Moderator Agreement

Moderating a group is an unofficial, voluntary, non-permanent position. We reserve the right to revoke that position for any user at any time. We hope you use it as a leadership role. If you choose to moderate a group, you agree to the following:

**4.1.1** You may not enter into any form of agreement on behalf of Communote, or the community which you moderate, without our written approval.

**4.1.2** You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties. You may, however, brag about it on your resume.

**4.1.3** When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement in communities you moderate, you agree to remove it.

**4.1.4** You will terminate your moderator status when you are no longer willing to perform moderator duties. The exception is if you are managing a page for a periodic course, in which case we urge you to maintain your moderator status until the next period.

**4.1.5** You agree to follow petitions with more than 2/3 approval on DemocracyOS (when we form our own)

###4.2 Termination

To give up your position as moderator, you must either appoint other moderator(s) or hold an election, unless there are already moderators on the team.

##5 Spam

###5.1 Junk

You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, audio or other material that we deem to be junk or spam. Cluttering Communote with this sort of content reduces the quality of the Communote experience for others.

###5.2 False Advertising

You are also prohibited from false advertising products. This includes:

1. Claiming functionality of a product with certainty.
2. Presenting an unatainable price of a product (e.g. hidden fees or not including tax when necessessary without disclaimer).

##6 Edits

You may not purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on Communote unless you have permission to by the user (as in the case of a shared document). This is intended to respect the privacy of Communote users who delete or edit their content, and is not intended to abridge the fair use or the expressive rights shared by us all.

##7 Leave Us Alone

**7.1**: You agree not to interrupt the serving of Communote, introduce malicious code onto Communote, make it difficult for anyone else to use Communote due to your actions, attempt to manipulate votes or Communote’s systems, or assist anyone in misusing Communote in any way. It takes a lot of work to maintain Communote. Be cool.

**7.2**: We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a Communote security issue, please send an email to [support@communote.co](mailto:support@communote.co).

##8 Accessing Communote

###8.1 Communote API

Use of the Communote API is not yet allowed. We will inform you when we are ready and we will link to the API documents here.

###8.2 Others

**8.2.1** We encourage the creation of other ways to access Communote, including browser extensions and mobile and desktop applications. We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any mobile or desktop application not produced by us.

**8.2.2** If you produce or maintain a browser extension or application, you agree not to purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on Communote without their permission.
