-----------------------------

Hello Communote members and people of the Internet! We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "agreement") between Communote ("we", "our," "us") and you. This agreement sets the terms of your use of the Communote website and services ("Communote") that include all groups and the Livefyre comments on the Communote domain. This agreement, like this website is meant to encourage a fair and tolerant place for discussion and freedom of speech.

##1	Legal
###1.1	Introduction

This agreement is a legal contract between you and Communote. By using this website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use our services. Please take a look at our privacy policy—it explains how we collect and use your information.

###1.2	Access

**1.2.1**	Communote is dedicated to providing equal access to all user-submitted documents on our site.

**1.2.2**	Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement: (1) suspend your ability to comment, (2) temporarily limit Your Account or Communote Premium membership, and/or (3) remove any of your User Content from Communote.

**1.2.3**	We reserve the right to monitor Communote, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all. However, since the privacy of our users is important, we aim to use the data strictly for purposes of identifying the number of accesses of documents as opposed to who is accessing what documents. Communote will not sell any of your information to any 3rd parties and we aim to implement in-house analytics soon.

###1.3	Purpose

**1.3.1**	You may not use Communote to break the law, violate an individual's privacy, or infringe any person or entity’s intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.

**1.3.2** Communote is intended to be a place for your entertainment. We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you read on communote.

**1.3.3** Communote is not intended to be a marketplace for any goods or services aside from the literary works on the site. For this reason, any transactions you undertake as a result of content on communote is your responsibility alone, so be careful.

Alternatively, you can browse communote without logging in.

**1.4.2** You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.

**1.4.3** You may not license, transfer, sell, or assign Your Account without our written approval.

###1.5 Premium

You may also join our premium membership program, communote premium, by paying a monthly fee, or if someone gifts you a membership. This user agreement applies to communote premium members. communote premium does not confer any benefits other than those listed here, it is not currency, it is a membership-based service, and its features are subject to change.

###1.6 Payment Information

You may also submit your debit or credit card information ("Payment Information") via the website as part of communote or to purchase other products or services via communote. communote uses third party service providers to process your payment information.

##3 Communote rules

###3.1 Key Rules

These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect kids, keep communote running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on communote. You must:

**3.1.1 Keep Everyone Safe**: You agree to not intentionally jeopardize the health and safety of others or yourself.

**3.1.2 Keep Others' Personal Information Off Communote**: You agree to not post anyone else's sensitive personal information that relates to that person's real world or online identity. ??Would this contradict news articles??

**3.1.3 Do Not Incite Harm**: You agree not to encourage harm against people. This includes threatening to harm others, especially not their moms.

**3.1.4 Protect Kids**: You agree not to post any child pornography or sexually suggestive content involving minors.

**3.1.5 Take Personal Responsibility**: As you use communote, please remember that your speech may have consequences and could lead to criminal and civil liability.

**3.1.6 Use disclaimers to reduce liabilities**: is your content potentially dangerous, age-restricted (nudity), or could offend certain groups?

###3.2 Community Rules

**3.2.1** Communities may define their own rules and enforce them as they see fit, providing they do not violate the terms of this agreement.

**3.2.2** Forming a community immediately makes you the initial moderator and means you must follow through with the duties of being a moderator

##4 Moderators

###4.1 Moderator Agreement

Moderating a group is an unofficial, voluntary, non-permanent position. We reserve the right to revoke that position for any user at any time. We hope you use it as a leadership role. If you choose to moderate a group, you agree to the following:

**4.1.1** You may not enter into any form of agreement on behalf of Communote, or the community which you moderate, without our written approval.

**4.1.2** You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties. You may, however, brag about it on your resume.

**4.1.3** When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement in communities you moderate, you agree to remove it.

**4.1.4** You will terminate your moderator status when you are no longer willing to perform moderator duties. The exception is if you are managing a page for a periodic course, in which case we urge you to maintain your moderator status until the next period.

**4.1.5** You agree to follow petitions with more than 2/3 approval on DemocracyOS (when we form our own)

###4.2 Termination

To give up your position as moderator, you must either appoint other moderator(s) or hold an election, unless there are already moderators on the team.

##5 Spam

You may not post any graphics, text, photographs, images, audio or other material that we deem to be junk or spam. Cluttering communote with this sort of content reduces the quality of the communote experience for others.

##6 Edits

You may not purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on Communote unless you have permission to by the user (as in the case of a shared document). This is intended to respect the privacy of communote users who delete or edit their content, and is not intended to abridge the fair use or the expressive rights shared by us all.

##7 Leave Us Alone

**7.1**: You agree not to interrupt the serving of communote, introduce malicious code onto communote, make it difficult for anyone else to use communote due to your actions, attempt to manipulate votes or communote’s systems, or assist anyone in misusing communote in any way. It takes a lot of work to maintain communote. Be cool.

**7.2**: We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a Communote security issue, please send an email to [support@communote.co](mailto:support@communote.co).

##8 Accessing communote

###8.1 Communote API

Use of the communote API is not yet allowed. We will inform you when we are ready and we will link to the API documents here.

###8.2 Others

**8.2.1** We encourage the creation of other ways to access communote, including browser extensions and mobile and desktop applications. We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any mobile or desktop application not produced by us.

**8.2.2** If you produce or maintain a browser extension or application, you agree not to purposefully negate any user's actions to delete or edit their content on communote without their permission.

##9 Trix are for kids

...and communote is not.

Communote is not currently directed at people under the age of 13, and communote does not knowingly collect any personal information from such people. If you know that a user under the age of 13 is accessing communote, please contact us at [support@communote.co](mailto:support@communote.co). If you are under the age of 13 and wish to submit something to Communote, you must give it to your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to upload for you on their account. This is because we are not yet equipped to comply with international regulations, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

##10 DMCA

###10.1 Copyright, the DMCA, and Takedowns

**10.1.1** We will respond to legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and we retain the right to remove user content on communote that we deem to be infringing the copyright of others.

**10.2.2** Upon receiving a counter-notice we will forward it to the complaining party and tell them we will restore your content within 10 business days. If that party does not notify us that they have filed an action to enjoin your use of that content on communote before that period passes, we will consider restoring your user content to the site.

##11 Additional Legalities

Please read the following very carefully. Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Where jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.

###11.1 Real Age

When we ask for your age, put your real age or we reserve the right to fine your account upon learning your true age.

###11.2 Indemnity

**11.2.1** All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to Communote remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.

**11.2.2** Specifically, you agree to hold communote, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of communote, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.

Communote is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind.

###11.4 Limitation of Liability

**11.4.1** We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use communote, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

You may have other rights that vary from state to state.

**11.4.2** You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of communote.
