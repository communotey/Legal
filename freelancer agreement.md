1 Introduction
--------------

THIS AGREEMENT made between Communote (the "Employer"), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, and having its principal place of business at Toronto; and you (the "Worker") effective on date _____.

Before signing this agreement you must agree to the terms of the nondisclosure agreement.

2 Compensation
------------

All reasonable expenses arising out of employment shall be reimbursed assuming they have been authorized prior to being incurred and with the provision of appropriate receipts.

The following is a long term agreement of entitlement to equity or equity derivative options. Equity derivative options are essentially coupons that let you purchase equity from the Employer at a discounted price.

Each task you complete entitles you to equity derivative options that you have the option of purchasing within 1 year of receiving it. Your quantity of options will vary from task to task and will be decided on upon assignment. If you fail to complete a task by the specified time, the Employer retains the right to remove you from a project and relinquish all consequential options associated with completing the task.

3 Harassment
------------

Your communication with fellow employees is subject to the restrictions of the harassment policy. That means a one strike tolerance rule of removal from the company.

7 Termination
-------------

The Employer reserves all rights to terminate the Worker at any time. The Worker is entitled to a reference letter and a reason for firing. That means the worker will have to re-apply to continue to work for the company.
