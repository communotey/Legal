title: Harassment Policy
layout: post
---

We want to ensure that our users feel safe using our site. That’s why we want to make a harassment policy. Unfortunately, pointing out people’s flaws can often be mistaken as harassment.

We believe that criticism and discussions are important. Pointing out hard facts about people to show their faults is what helps them identify where to improve themselves and become a better person.

That is why we’ve decided to specifically define harassment that is not allowed on our site:

* **Ad Hominem**: attacking a person instead of/in addition to addressing the argument; negative remarks about another user that does not contribute to the discussion
* **Catcalling**: unwarranted comments to a person that are sexually motivated and tend to compliment a person’s body as opposed to taste. For example, you could say “Your comment is very insightful” or “Your hair looks nice in your photo”, but not “Your boobs look great in that top!” or “The scene on page 3 reminds me of what I want to do to you.” Being told that someone is sexually pleasing by a stranger is not complimentary because it implies no individuality on their part, only that they fall into your sexual preferences. They have done nothing to do that, besides exist, and as they do not know you, they have not cultivated the feature you prefer with any idea of being pleasing to you, or to anyone but themselves.

* **Ignoring**: repeatedly saying people’s points are wrong without attempting to address/acknowledge counter arguments

This policy operates without contradiction to any bans on illicit publications contained in the Canadian Criminal Code. Some of these include:

* **Child porn**: [section 163.1](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-163.1.html)
	* e.g. of violation: an erotica containing a person under the age of 18
	* e.g. of safe: publication to raise awareness of sexual abuse
* **Hate Propaganda**: [section 318, 319](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html)
	* e.g. of violation: advocating for genocide
	* e.g. of safe: people should be able to boycott products from Israel
* **Harassment**: [section 264](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-264.html)
	* e.g. of violation: repeatedly calling a larger member a whale
	* e.g. of safe: expressing an opinion that fat people should pay for two seats on an airplane

Exceptions can be made
